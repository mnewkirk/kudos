# kudos
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/mnewkirk/kudos/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/mnewkirk/kudos?branch=master)

##Kudos is a basic thank-you system to let people know that you appreciate them.

This is still very much a work in development, but the intended implementation is to have a web-based submission/review of kudos with potential User integration (to get avatar images, single sign-in, etc.).
