##Kudos is a basic thank-you system (i.e. reflection wall) to let people know that you appreciate them.

This is still very much a work in development, but the intended implementation is to have a web-based submission/review of kudos with potential User integration (to get avatar images, single sign-in, etc.).

It's also an opportunity for me to learn more about Spring, OAuth, Thymeleaf, and other technologies.
