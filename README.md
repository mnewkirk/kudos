# kudos
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mnewkirk/kudos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mnewkirk/kudos)

##Kudos is a basic thank-you system to let people know that you appreciate them.

This is still very much a work in development, but the intended implementation is to have a web-based submission/review of kudos with potential User integration (to get avatar images, single sign-in, etc.).
